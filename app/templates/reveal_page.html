                <p>Phishing attacks are one of the most common ways that cybercriminals gain access to sensitive information and systems. By conducting simulated phishing tests, we can help you recognize and avoid real phishing attempts.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Always check the sender's email address carefully</li>
                    <li>Hover over links before clicking to see the actual URL</li>
                    <li>Be suspicious of urgent requests for personal information</li>
                    <li>When in doubt, contact IT directly using known contact information</li>
